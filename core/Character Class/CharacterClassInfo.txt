Professor: Standard class. Deal moderate close damage as well as range and magic. The professors are the most honorable class since the beginning of time. Professors will try to teach students and punish the bad apples as see fit. The professors have an obligation toward the head of department (H.o.D) to follow and serve. The professor's loyalty toward the H.o.D will never weaken unless he/she is relieved from duty (get fired).

TA: Teaching assistant. This class is a professor wanna-be but can't due to the young age, the lack neccessary knowledge (magic) and the high desire for earning a living rather than teaching. TAs excels in range (Grade assignment) interaction with student as well as close combat (in class, proctor...) However, the tremendous range ability has its down side, the lack of knowledge (magic).

Advisor: (In process)...
